DATA:           <data> defined map data
tilesize:       set the size of ground images
showcollisions: set if collisions can be che seen visually ("true" or "false")
camdistance:    set camera distance from playable character

    ROW:        <row> starts a grid row
    
        TILE    <tile> : creates a single tile
        walkable:       set the tile walkable or not
        
            GROUND:             <ground />  represents a ground object, every new ground in the same tile will overwrite previous ground image.
                                            if alpha channel is present, colors will be merged.
            url:                url of resource
            walkable:		set if ground can be walkable ("true" or "false", default: true)
            
            
            CHARACTER           <character /> represents a character playable in the game or an NPC 
            url:                url of resource
            inclination:        inclination of character
            scale:              scale character
            playable:           defines if character is playable or not in an exact moment
            hitboxscale:             defines the character collision
            
            
            
            OBJECT:             <object /> normal object in world, has collisions
            url:                url of the resource found by the resourcemanager
            walkable:           set if object can be walkable ("true" or "false", default: false)
            inclination:        inclination of object
            offsetwidth:        used to stretch collisions in 3d mode horizontally
            offsetheight:       used to stretch collisions in 3d mode vertically
            elevation:          set manually elevation of object
            scale:              scale objects
            offsethorizontal:   place object horizontally pixel perfect
            offsetvertical:     place object vertically pixel perfect
            collisionmode:      can be "3d" that let character go behind an object or "2d" for completely collide all image with very low inclination degrees
            
            GRASS:              <grass /> special grass object
            
Events API:
