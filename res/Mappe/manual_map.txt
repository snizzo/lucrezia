                stops and delete long effect based on name
            
            audioManager.clearAllEffects()
                auto called when changing map, clears all long effects playing
            
------PERSISTENCE
            
            persistence.save(key, value)
                save a variable named <key> with <value> cross levels

            persistence.del(key)
                delete a variable with <key>
	    

SNIPPETS:
baloons.push('Chiara', 'Ehi! Non toccare la mia pianta!', 'chiara')
audioManager.playLongEffect('rain', 'sfx/rain_indoor.ogg')
lamp = pGrid.getObjectById("lamp1")
if persistence.load("cameraState") == 1:
persistence.save("cameraState", 1)
